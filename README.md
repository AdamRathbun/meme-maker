## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

I built this project primarily using React. This app pulls images from an API of some of the most popular memes. You can change it by clicking the botton, which calls the API for a random meme image. When you enter your captions into (up to) two text fields, the data is collected in real time and instantly populated into the image at the top and bottom. 

## Optimizations

I would've liked to create my own meme API, with more customizations on how the text interacts with the image, given more time.

## Lessons Learned:

This was a fun project I used to explore React more.
